// The intent is to run this only once as it will both clear and seed the db with test info

// Require the Image model

// Require the data

// Delete any existing documents in the Images collection

// Use insertMany and feed it the seed data

// Log a successful result

// Log an error if things go sideways

// Close the connection to the db after the process is complete
